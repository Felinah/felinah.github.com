    <h1>Journal of a glitchy nose </h1>
    <p>On the 7th of March 2020 I have lost my sense of smell. <br>
      It might have been corona, I don't know, but for almost 3 months my nose has been blinded. </p>

    <h2>Poem for noses</h2>
    <p class="poem">
    Smelling used to be my favorite sense <br>
    It's also because I have a big nose I guess üëÉ <br>
    What can I do with this giant on my face <br>
    If I can't sense? üòî<br>
    <br> 
    Three months in the dark üåë <br>
    I have endured <br>
    No stimulation <br>
    No sensation üôä <br>
    <br>
    First thing I smelled <br>
    Was a bit of rice üçö <br>
    What a paradise! <br>
    It was about two months into the clash. üí• <br>
    <br>
    A few weeks later a banana üçå,<br>
    Some wine üç∑,<br>
    And finally a bit of coffee ‚òï <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, how nice.  <br>
    <br>
    Until one day <br>
    When as I washed my hair üßñ‚Äç <br>
    A potent smell invaded my nose <br>
    Of wax, vanilla, sour and distress <br>
    Ah, what a mess. <br>
    <br>
    The smell came and it planned to stay <br>
    A week, 10 days, <br>
    A waxy glaze üïØÔ∏è<br>
    All over my face. <br>
  </p>
    
    
   
    
    
    
    <h2>Physiotherapy for the nose</h2>
    <p>
      Recently I have discovered that if you loose your sense of smell (if your nervous symptom is damaged), 
      it can take a really long time to get it back. I have therefore started a programme of smell training. 
      Hereby I will document how this evolves in the next weeks. <br> <br>
      The first set I am using contains the following smells:
      <ul>
      <li> Roses</li>
      <li> Lemon</li>
      <li> Cloves</li>
      <li> Eucalyptus</li>
        </ul>
     The following table documents the strength (S) and the truth (T) of each smell. 
        </p>

    Notes:<br>
    *day 3 of measuring - finally some eucalyptus! Crazy to see how it alternates. <br>
