    <h1>Journal of a glitchy nose </h1>
    <p>On the 7th of March 2020 I have lost my sense of smell. <br>
      It might have been corona, I don't know, but for almost 3 months my nose has been blinded. </p>

      <h2>Poem for noses</h2>
    <p class="poem">
    Smelling used to be my favorite sense <br>
    It's also because I have a big nose I guess 👃 <br>
    What can I do with this giant on my face <br>
    If I can't sense? 😔<br>
    <br> 
    Three months in the dark 🌑 <br>
    I have endured <br>
    No stimulation <br>
    No sensation 🙊 <br>
    <br>
    First thing I smelled <br>
    Was a bit of rice 🍚 <br>
    What a paradise! <br>
    It was about two months into the clash. 💥 <br>
    <br>
    A few weeks later a banana 🍌,<br>
    Some wine 🍷,<br>
    And finally a bit of coffee ☕ <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, how nice.  <br>
    <br>
    Until one day <br>
    When as I washed my hair 🧖‍ <br>
    A potent smell invaded my nose <br>
    Of wax, vanilla, sour and distress <br>
    Ah, what a mess. <br>
    <br>
    The smell came and it planned to stay <br>
    A week, 10 days, <br>
    A waxy glaze 🕯️<br>
    All over my face. <br>
